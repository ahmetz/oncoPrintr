# oncoPrintr

This is an R package to plot oncoPrints similar to what one can do at [cBio portal](http://www.cbioportal.org/oncoprinter.jsp). Users can select either auto ordering of genes, or supply a gene order (can be partial). The output includes the gene and sample order to allow for plotting additional charts that can align with the oncoPrint.
